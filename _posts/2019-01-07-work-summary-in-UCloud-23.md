### Hash Func result length and bit size

MD5 hexdecimal(hex) string length is 32, MD5 result data bit size is 128 bits. One hex string char is 4 bits.

MD5 hashes are 128 bits in length and generally represented by 32 hex digits.

As we know SHA-1 hashes are 160 bits in length and generally represented by 40 hex digits.

SHA-2 hashes are 256bit in length and generally represented by 64 hex digits

So SHA-512 can be represented by 128 hex digits
